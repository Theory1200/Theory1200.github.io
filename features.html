	<h1 class = "center"> Features </h1>
	<h2 class = "center"> Voice changing </h2>
	<p class = "center"> What makes Voicey different from any other chatting application? Well, it's the anonimity. Voicey the option to toggle on a free voice-chainging feature while in a voice call to protect your identity and allow you talk about things that might embarass you, without fear of being recognised and judged. </p>
	<h2 class = "center"> Reward system (Rhyme Points) </h2>
	<p class = "center"> To ensure a safe a friendly experience for the users of Voicey, our team has opted to rewards good user behaviour, as well as punish bad user behaviour with a blend of positive and negative reinforcement. After every completed Voicey chat, user have the option to rate each other based on how friendly and involved they were during the chat. These ratings then in turn reward the well rated users with Rhyme points. The more Rhyme points a user has, the more access they have to in app features such as more voice-changing options, many cosmetic rewards and access to the creation of private rooms. </p>
    <h2 class = "center"> Moderation </h2>
    <p class = "center"> Our moderation team is hard at work to keep the Voicey community a safe and welcoming environment. They do so by fact-checking user reports and appliying appropriate punishments such as deducting Rhyme points, removing privileges and timing out or banning problematic users, either temporarily or permanently. </p>
    <h2 class = "center"> Limited access mode </h2>
    <p class = "center"> Not everyone has access to state of the art internet with fast speeds and unlimited usage. Limited access mode exists for those who want to limit their internet consumption or who want to run the app smoothly instead of slowing down everything for slightly less important features. The Limited Access mode, which can be toggled on in the settings, is a simpler version of Voicey that prioritises efficiency over glamour to provide a better experience for those who can't or don't want to experience all of the extra Voicey features. </p>
