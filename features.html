	<h1 class = "title"> Features </h1>
	<h2 class = "heading_style"> Voice Changing </h2>
	<p class = "para_styling"> What makes Voicey different from any other chatting application? Well, it's the anonimity. Voicey offers the option to toggle on a free voice-changing feature while in a voice call to protect your identity and allow you talk about things that might embarass you, without fear of being recognised and judged. </p>
	<h2 class = "heading_style"> Reward System (Rhyme Points) </h2>
	<p class = "para_styling"> To ensure a safe a friendly experience for the users of Voicey, our team has opted to reward good user behaviour as well as punish bad user behaviour with a blend of positive and negative reinforcement through the use of Rhyme Points. After every completed Voicey chat, users have the option to rate each other based on how friendly and involved they were during the chat. These ratings then reward the well rated users with Rhyme Points. The more Rhyme Points a user has, the more access they have to in-app features such as more voice-changing options, many cosmetic rewards and access to the creation of private rooms. </p>
    <h2 class = "heading_style"> Moderation </h2>
    <p class = "para_styling"> Our moderation team is hard at work to keep the Voicey community a safe and welcoming environment. They do so by fact-checking user reports and appliying appropriate punishments such as deducting Rhyme Points, removing privileges and timing out or banning problematic users, either temporarily or permanently on a case to case basis. </p>
    <h2 class = "heading_style"> Limited Access Mode </h2>
    <p class = "para_styling"> Not everyone has access to state of the art internet with fast speeds and unlimited usage. Limited Access mode exists for those who want to limit their internet consumption or who want to prioritise performance by removing or putting less emphasis on less necessary features such as emoticons or GIFs. The Limited Access mode, which can be toggled on in the settings, is a simpler version of Voicey that prioritises efficiency over glamour to provide a better experience for those who can't or don't want to experience all of the extra Voicey features. </p>
