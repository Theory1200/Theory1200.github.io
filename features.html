	<h1> Features </h1>
	<h2> Voice changing <h5>
	<p> What makes Voicey different from any other chatting application? Well, it's the anonimity. Voicey the option to toggle on a free voice-chainging feature while in a voice call to protect your identity and allow you talk about things that might embarass you, without fear of being recognised and judged. </p>
	<h5> Reward system (Rhyme Points) <h5>
	<p> To ensure a safe a friendly experience for the users of Voicey, our team has opted to rewards good user behaviour, as well as punish bad user behaviour with a blend of positive and negative reinforcement. After every completed Voicey chat, user have the option to rate each other based on how friendly and involved they were during the chat. These ratings then in turn reward the well rated users with Rhyme points. The more Rhyme points a user has, the more access they have to in app features such as more voice-changing options, many cosmetic rewards and access to the creation of private rooms. </p>
